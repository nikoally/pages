## Introduction
Cooling systems are essential in industrial facilities to regulate temperature, ensure equipment longevity, and maintain product quality. Two primary cooling technologies used in industrial settings are **chillers** and **cooling towers**. This module explores their operation, energy efficiency considerations, and best practices for optimization.

## Chillers

Chillers are refrigeration systems that remove heat from a process fluid or space. They operate using either a **vapor compression cycle** or an **absorption refrigeration cycle**.

### Types of Chillers
1. **Air-Cooled Chillers**
   - Use ambient air to remove heat from the refrigerant
   - Suitable for facilities with limited water availability
   - Higher energy consumption compared to water-cooled chillers
   
2. **Water-Cooled Chillers**
   - Use water from a cooling tower to dissipate heat
   - More efficient in large-scale applications
   - Require additional maintenance due to water treatment needs

3. **Absorption Chillers**
   - Use heat instead of electricity to drive the cooling cycle
   - Often powered by waste heat or steam from industrial processes
   - Lower electrical consumption but higher capital costs

### Chiller Efficiency Metrics
- **Coefficient of Performance (COP)**: Ratio of cooling output to energy input
- **Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV)**: Measures efficiency under varying load conditions
- **Kilowatts per Ton (kW/ton)**: Power required to produce one ton of cooling

### Optimization Strategies
- **Proper sizing**: Avoid oversizing, which leads to inefficiencies
- **Variable speed drives (VSDs)**: Adjust compressor speed based on cooling demand
- **Regular maintenance**: Clean heat exchangers, check refrigerant levels, and inspect insulation
- **Load shifting**: Use thermal energy storage to shift cooling loads to off-peak hours

## Cooling Towers

Cooling towers remove heat from water-cooled systems by evaporating water into the atmosphere. They are widely used in conjunction with water-cooled chillers to enhance efficiency.

### Types of Cooling Towers
1. **Open-Circuit (Wet) Cooling Towers**
   - Water directly contacts air, allowing heat dissipation through evaporation
   - Highly efficient but requires water treatment to prevent scaling and biological growth

2. **Closed-Circuit (Dry) Cooling Towers**
   - Use a heat exchanger to separate process water from cooling air
   - Lower water consumption but less efficient than open-circuit towers

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Approach Temperature**: Difference between cooled water temperature and ambient wet-bulb temperature
- **Cycles of Concentration (COC)**: Ratio of dissolved solids in recirculating water to makeup water
- **Drift Loss**: Water loss due to fine droplets escaping with exhaust air

### Optimization Strategies
- **Install variable frequency drives (VFDs)**: Adjust fan speeds based on load
- **Monitor water chemistry**: Prevent scaling and biological contamination

## Activity

Objective:

Calculate the energy and demand savings associated with upgrading an older chiller system to a more efficient model using provided efficiency, runtime, and capacity data.

Problem Statement:

A manufacturing plant operates a set of four Carrier chillers, three of which were installed in 1995 and have degraded efficiency. The original efficiency of these older chillers was 0.67 kW/ton, but due to degradation over 29 years, the efficiency has worsened to 0.90 kW/ton. The plant is considering replacing these with modern chillers with an efficiency of 0.60 kW/ton.

Using the following provided data, calculate the annual energy savings (kWh) from upgrading the older chillers.

Given Data:
	- Chiller capacity = 1,250 tons
	- Efficiency of degraded chillers = 0.90 kW/ton
	- Efficiency of new chillers = 0.60 kW/ton
	- Annual runtime of older chillers = 8,760 hours Ã— 54.57% = 4,780.33 hours
	- Degradation factor formula:
\\[\text{Efficiency}_{\text{Degraded}} = \frac{\text{Efficiency}_{\text{Original}}}{(1 - 0.01)^{\text{Age}}}\\]

Tasks:
	1.	Recalculate the degraded efficiency of the older chillers using the formula above, assuming an original efficiency of 0.67 kW/ton and an age of 29 years.
    
	2.	Calculate the annual energy savings in kWh using the formula:
\\[\text{Consumption Savings} = \text{Capacity} \times (\text{Efficiency}{\text{Degraded}} - \text{Efficiency}{\text{New}}) \times \text{Annual Runtime}\\]
