Today, I had the opportunity to present my work on thermal drone applications at the Southern New England Industrial Training and Assessment Center semiannual board meeting. My presentation, titled “Applications of Thermal Drones: Energy Assessments for Efficiency and Reliability,” explored how infrared-equipped UAVs can enhance inspections for solar panels, buildings, and industrial systems. I discussed the fundamentals of thermal imaging, the drone hardware and software stack, and how machine learning can be leveraged for more accurate defect detection. I also shared case studies from recent assessments, including a rooftop PV inspection and a 3D thermal model of a UConn building. The discussion highlighted the growing potential of thermal drones to enable non-intrusive, rapid, and cost-effective energy assessments—an exciting step forward for manufacturers and facilities aiming to boost energy efficiency and reliability.
