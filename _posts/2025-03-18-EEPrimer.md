## Introduction
Electrical engineering principles are crucial when conducting industrial energy assessments. Understanding these concepts can greatly enhance your ability to identify energy-saving opportunities. This primer introduces key electrical fundamentals applicable to energy assessments, including power factor, three-phase power, motor efficiency, and other related concepts.

## 1. Voltage, Current, and Resistance
- **Voltage (V)**: The electrical potential difference, measured in volts, drives current through circuits.
- **Current (I)**: The flow of electrons, measured in amperes (amps, A).
- **Resistance (R)**: Opposition to current flow, measured in ohms (Ω). Ohm's Law relates these concepts:  
  \\[ V = IR \\]

## 2. Power
Electrical power quantifies the rate of energy use, measured in watts (W). Real power (P) represents actual energy consumed by equipment.
- **Real Power (P)**: Actual usable power, measured in watts (W).
- **Reactive Power (Q)**: Power stored temporarily and returned to the source, measured in volt-amperes reactive (VAR).
- **Apparent Power (S)**: Combination of real and reactive power, measured in volt-amperes (VA).

The relationship between these powers is described as:  
\\[ S^2 = P^2 + Q^2 \\]

## 3. Power Factor
Power factor (PF) indicates how effectively electrical power is being utilized. It is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power.
\\[ PF = \frac{P}{S} \\]
- A power factor close to 1.0 (unity) is ideal. A low power factor (often caused by inductive loads like motors) results in inefficiencies and higher electricity charges.
- Improving power factor (via capacitors or power factor correction equipment) can reduce energy costs.

## 4. Three-Phase Power
Three-phase power is commonly used in industrial environments due to its efficiency in power distribution.
- **Line Voltage ($$V_L$$)**: Voltage between any two phases.
- **Phase Voltage ($$V_P$$)**: Voltage across a single phase, measured between phase and neutral.
- **Line Current ($$I_L$$)**: Current in the transmission lines.

For a balanced three-phase load, the total real power is calculated as:
\\[ P = \sqrt{3} \times V_L \times I_L \times PF \\]



## 5. Motors and Motor Efficiency
Electric motors are major energy users in industrial settings. Motor efficiency indicates the effectiveness of converting electrical energy into mechanical work.
- **Motor Efficiency (η)** is defined as:
\\[ η = \frac{Mechanical~Power~Output}{Electrical~Power~Input} \\]
- High-efficiency motors minimize electrical losses and significantly reduce operational costs.

Common causes of low motor efficiency:
- Oversizing motors relative to load requirements
- Poor maintenance
- Running motors unnecessarily or at inefficient loads

Strategies to improve efficiency include installing properly sized motors, scheduling maintenance, and using variable frequency drives (VFDs).

## 6. Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs)
VFDs control motor speed and torque by varying frequency and voltage of the supplied electricity, allowing motors to operate efficiently at varying loads. Benefits include:
- Improved energy efficiency and reduced energy consumption
- Enhanced motor control
- Extended motor lifespan
