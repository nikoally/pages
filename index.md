I'm a **dual-degree senior at UConn** studying Management and Engineering for Manufacturing alongside Applied Mathematics (GPA: 3.948, University Scholar). My research focuses on **physics-informed machine learning for manufacturing systems**, **stochastic optimization in energy efficiency**, and **renewable energy infrastructure**.

## About Me
I serve as **Lead Student at UConn's Industrial Training and Assessment Center (ITAC)**, where I conduct energy efficiency assessments at manufacturing facilities and have recommended over **$4 million in energy savings**. My research combines rigorous mathematical modeling with practical engineering applications, spanning from **computer vision for solar panel inspection** to **queueing theory for compressed air leak detection**. I'm currently applying to PhD programs in Industrial and Operations Engineering, with research interests at the intersection of optimization, energy systems, and machine learning.

## Research Interests
- **Stochastic Optimization & Queueing Theory** – Developing M/M/∞ models for compressed air leak detection and maintenance scheduling in manufacturing facilities.
- **Physics-Informed Machine Learning** – Applying computer vision and thermal imaging analysis for automated photovoltaic system inspection and degradation assessment.
- **Energy Systems & Industrial Sustainability** – Integrating economic analysis with technical modeling to optimize renewable energy maintenance strategies and manufacturing energy efficiency.

## Current Projects
- **Compressed Air Leak Detection via Stochastic Modeling** – Developing queueing-theoretic frameworks for optimizing ultrasonic leak detection in manufacturing environments (NSF GRFP research proposal).
- **Automated PV Inspection Using Drone-Based Thermal Imaging** – Building physics-informed machine learning models to detect solar panel defects and predict degradation patterns (CESIP Fellowship with Eversource).
- **Industrial Energy Efficiency Assessment** – Leading on-site assessments across Connecticut manufacturing facilities, analyzing electrical systems, compressed air networks, and thermal processes.
