# Nicholas Bailey
**Engineer | Researcher | Data Enthusiast**

Welcome to my personal website! I am an **Engineering & Mathematics student** with a strong interest in **machine learning applications in engineering**, **energy systems**, and **data-driven decision-making**.

## About Me
I have experience in **engineering research, supply chain optimization, and energy efficiency consulting**. My work spans from **drone-based photovoltaic (PV) inspection research** to **machine learning for manufacturing applications**. Previously, I interned at **Lockheed Martin** in a supply chain engineering role and worked with the **Southern New England Industrial Assessment Center (SNE-IAC)** to improve energy efficiency for small and medium-sized manufacturers.

## Research Interests
- **AI/ML for Engineering** â€“ Applying **semantic segmentation** for PV inspection and evaluating **surrogate modeling techniques** in engineering design.
- **Renewable Energy & Grid Optimization** â€“ Exploring UAV-based inspections and optimizing **photovoltaic (PV) maintenance strategies**.
- **Manufacturing & Supply Chain Engineering** â€“ Investigating **data-driven insights** for industrial process improvements.

## Projects
- **Drone-Based PV Inspection** â€“ Studying feasibility, ROI, and software integration for **thermal drone inspection** of solar panels.
- **Surrogate Modeling in Engineering** â€“ Analyzing **Kriging, ANN, RBF**, and other surrogate methods for engineering applications.
- **Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing** â€“ Conducting **on-site industrial assessments** and developing **custom energy models**.
