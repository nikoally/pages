## Activity: Energy Savings Calculation Guide

### Task 1: Turning Off Compressors During Non-Production Hours (2:00 pm–4:00 pm)

**Step 1: Identify Non-Production Hours**

- Facility operational hours: 
  - Production: 6:00 am – 2:00 pm
  - Warehouse-only operation: 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm (compressors unnecessary)
- Calculate daily non-production hours (2 hours/day).

**Step 2: Calculate Compressor Average Current (I_avg)**

- Load provided dataset 
- Filter the data to select only non-production periods (2:00 pm–4:00 pm, weekdays only).
- Calculate the average current (amps) during these times.

**Step 2: Calculate Energy Consumption**

- Assume the compressor operates at **208 volts, three-phase**.
- Calculate power using:

  \[
  \text{Power (Watts)} = \text{Voltage} \times \sqrt{3} \times \text{Average Current}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate Annual Energy Savings**

- Determine the total weekly energy use during non-production hours.
- Multiply by total operational weeks per year to estimate annual energy savings (convert Wh to kWh).

### Task 2: Eliminating Compressed Air Usage for Workstation Cleaning

**Step 1: Calculate Daily Compressed Air Usage**

- Number of workstations: **6**
- Usage pattern: **2 minutes per 30 minutes** (equates to 4 minutes per hour)
- Daily usage duration per workstation: **4 minutes/hour × 8 hours/day**
- Calculate total compressed air usage (in cubic feet per day), given each gun is rated at **14 cfm @ 100 psi**.

**Step 2: Calculate Daily Energy Usage**

- Given: **0.24 kWh per 100 cubic feet (CCF)** of compressed air
- Convert total daily compressed air (cubic feet) into daily energy usage (kWh).

**Step 2: Calculate Annual Energy Savings**

- Scale daily energy usage to annual savings (accounting for 5 operational days/week and 52 weeks/year).

### Comparison & Recommendation

- Compare energy savings from Task 1 and Task 2.
- Determine which measure provides greater energy savings.
