Utility analysis is critical for identifying cost-saving opportunities in manufacturing energy assessments. It involves understanding your energy bills, identifying trends, and pinpointing inefficiencies.

## Types of Energy Bills

Manufacturing firms typically encounter these types of energy bills:

- **Electricity:** Powers machinery, lighting, HVAC, compressed air systems, refrigeration, and office equipment.
- **Natural Gas:** Commonly used for heating, boilers, process heat, ovens, and drying processes.
- **Propane:** Often used for heating, forklifts, portable heaters, or remote equipment in locations without natural gas infrastructure.
- **Fuel Oil:** Used primarily for boilers, heating, backup generators, or industrial furnaces, especially in locations without natural gas access.

## Overarching Recommendations

There's a few recommendations that are broadly applicable across many different types of energy bills. 

### 1. **Pay Bills on Time**
- Avoid late fees, which can typically range from 1% to 5% of the total bill.
- **Savings Calculation:**
  \[
  \text{Annual Savings} = \text{Average monthly late fee} \times 12
  \]

### 2. **Review and Switch Rate Plans**
- Many utilities offer multiple rate structures such as time-of-use (TOU) or demand-based tariffs.
- Calculate potential savings by comparing your current bill with hypothetical scenarios under alternative rate structures.
- **Savings Calculation:**
  \[
  \text{Annual Savings} = (\text{Current rate annual cost}) - (\text{Proposed rate annual cost})
  \]

### 3. **Third-party Energy Suppliers**
- Third-party suppliers might offer competitive energy rates compared to your current utility provider.
- Request quotes from alternative suppliers to compare pricing.
- **Savings Calculation:**
  \[
  \text{Annual Savings} = (\text{Current annual energy cost}) - (\text{Third-party annual energy cost})
  \]

### 4. **Tax-free Status**
- Many manufacturing firms are eligible for state tax exemptions on energy use.
- Typically, these taxes range from 3% to 10% of energy costs.
- **Savings Calculation:**
  \[
  \text{Annual Savings} = (\text{Energy costs}) \times (\text{Tax rate})
  \]

## **Power Factor Correction**

Power factor (PF) measures the efficiency of electricity use, specifically the ratio between real power (used to perform actual work, measured in kilowatts or kW) and apparent power (total power supplied, measured in kilovolt-amperes or kVA). A lower power factor indicates inefficiency, causing utilities to impose penalties (usually below a threshold like 0.90). 

- **Ideal PF:** Typically above 0.90 (or 90%).
- **Poor PF:** Below 0.90 may incur additional charges from utilities due to higher current draw and reduced grid efficiency.

In order to improve power factor, we generally recommend installing power factor correction equipment such as capacitors or capacitor banks, optimizing equipment use, or upgrading inefficient motors.


## How to Perform Utility Analysis

Effective utility analysis follows these general steps:

1. **Import Data into Excel**
    - Gather 12-24 months of energy bills.
    - Enter bill data into Excel, including:
        - Billing period dates
        - Total consumption (kWh, therms, gallons)
        - Peak demand (kW for electricity)
        - Total costs and any itemized charges (fixed charges, demand charges, etc.)

2. **Calculate Average Rates**
    - Calculate the average electricity rates:
        - Average electricity consumption rate ($/kWh) = total cost รท total kWh consumed.
        - Average electricity demand rate ($/kW) = total demand cost รท total billed peak demand.
    - For natural gas, propane, and fuel oil:
        - Average cost ($ per therm, gallon, or unit) = total cost รท total consumption.

3. **Graph Data and Analyze Trends**
    - Create visualizations, such as monthly consumption, costs, demand, and rate trends.
    - Identify seasonal fluctuations or irregular usage patterns indicating inefficiencies.

4. **Look for Recommendations**
    - Evaluate trends for anomalies, spikes, or inefficiencies.
    - Identify potential cost-saving opportunities, such as the ones mentioned above

## Activity

Using the data at the link below, conduct a utility analysis (I did step 1 for you). Then, calculate the average kW, kWh, and MMbtu rates. Note that the data provided is in CCF, so you will have to convert units. Finally, identify which recommendations would be relevant for this company.
