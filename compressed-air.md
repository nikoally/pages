## Summary

Compressed air is a crucial, yet costly, resource widely used in manufacturing for powering tools, actuators, and various processes. Although convenient, compressed air typically has efficiency rates of only around 10–15%, making it significantly more expensive than direct electrical power.

Compressed air systems consist of two main areas:

- **Supply Side:** Includes compressors, dryers, filters, and storage tanks.
- **Demand Side:** Includes distribution piping, secondary storage, leaks, and end-use applications.

Improving compressed air efficiency is vital for reducing energy costs, minimizing environmental impact, and achieving sustainability targets.

## Supply-Side Energy Saving Measures

### 1. Cold Air Intake

Using colder, denser air for compressor intake reduces the energy required for compression. Cooler air lowers energy consumption and improves the efficiency and lifespan of your compressor.

**Best Practice:**  
Draw compressor intake air from a cooler location (e.g., outside air or air-conditioned spaces) rather than from the hot compressor room.

### 2. Turn Off Compressors When Not in Use

Running compressors unloaded wastes significant energy. Older rotary screw compressors can use up to 85% of their full load power even when idle.

**Best Practice:**  
Use controls or scheduling to ensure compressors are turned off during low demand periods. Consider smaller compressors for low-load conditions.



### 3. Reduce Setpoint Pressure

Compressors often operate at higher pressures than needed. Every unnecessary 2 psi increase in pressure can increase energy use by approximately 1%.

**Best Practice:**  
Regularly measure pressure requirements and lower compressor pressure setpoints to the minimum needed by your facility’s processes.

### 4. Optimize Storage and Distribution

Adequate storage (receiver tanks) and proper piping reduce pressure drops and stabilize system performance. This minimizes the need for extra compressor runtime.

**Best Practice:**  
Design piping with minimal bends and appropriate diameter. Strategically place air receivers near heavy-use areas.

## Demand-Side Energy Saving Measures

### 1. Avoid Using Compressed Air for Personal Cooling

Using compressed air for personal cooling is highly inefficient and wasteful.

**Best Practice:**  
Educate employees about compressed air costs and provide alternative cooling solutions, such as fans.

### 2. Use Engineered Air Nozzles

Open-ended tubes or basic air guns consume excessive air. Engineered air nozzles significantly reduce air consumption and noise levels.

**Best Practice:**  
Replace open-ended hoses and simple nozzles with engineered alternatives designed to maximize efficiency and airflow.

**Diagram Suggestion:**  
- Side-by-side demonstration of airflow and consumption rates of engineered nozzles versus open-ended tubes.

### 3. Detect and Fix Leaks

Leaks typically account for 20–30% of a plant’s total compressed air usage, resulting in considerable waste.

**Best Practice:**  
Conduct routine leak inspections using ultrasonic detection or simple auditory inspections, and promptly repair identified leaks.

### 4. Optimize End-Use Applications

Compressed air is often used where more efficient alternatives exist, such as electric motors or blowers.

**Best Practice:**  
Identify non-essential compressed air uses and replace them with more efficient alternatives.

Examples include:
- Electric blowers instead of compressed air for continuous cleaning.
- Mechanical agitators instead of compressed air for liquid mixing.

## Activity

### Scenario Overview

You are conducting an energy assessment at a manufacturing facility. The facility operates daily from **6:00 am to 4:00 pm**, Monday to Friday. However, from **2:00 pm to 4:00 pm**, only the warehouse is active, which does not require compressed air.

### Observations from Site Visit:

- One large air compressor (100 hp) continuously operates at **120 psi**.
- The maximum pressure required by equipment is only **90 psi**.
- Compressor intake air is drawn from the hot compressor room (~90°F).
- Audible leaks were identified throughout distribution piping and at an old, unused packaging machine still connected to the system.
- At **6 workstations**, employees regularly use compressed air guns rated at **14 cfm @ 100 psi** to clean workstations. Observations showed each worker used compressed air for **2 minutes per 30 minutes**.
- Previous calculations have established that each **CCF** (100 cubic feet) of compressed air consumes **0.24 kWh**.


### Data Analysis Exercise

You have been provided two weeks of compressor CT (current transducer) data.

#### Task:

Analyze the scenario and calculate the annual energy savings (in kWh) achievable by:

**1. Turning off compressors during non-production warehouse-only hours (2:00 pm–4:00 pm).**  
**2. Eliminating the inappropriate use of compressed air for workstation cleaning.**

##### Step-by-step Guidance:

- **Production Schedule:**
  - Operating hours: 6:00 am–4:00 pm (10 hours/day).
  - Facility operates 5 days per week, 50 weeks per year.

- **Workstation Cleaning Usage:**
  - Number of workstations: 6
  - Usage per workstation: 2 mins every 30 mins
  - Total daily cleaning time per workstation: 4 mins/hr × 8 production hours (6 am–2 pm) = 32 mins/day/workstation
  - Air nozzle rating: 14 cfm at 100 psi

- **Energy Usage:**
  - Conversion rate: 1 CCF (100 cubic feet) of compressed air = 0.24 kWh

#### Analysis Questions:

1. **Calculate the annual energy savings (in kWh)** from turning compressors off during non-production warehouse-only hours.

2. **Calculate the annual energy savings (in kWh)** from eliminating compressed air workstation cleaning.

3. **Discuss which measure provides greater savings** and why implementing both measures is beneficial.
