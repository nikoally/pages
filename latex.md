Then, read this article: [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). 

Now, you should have a decent familarity with the general idea of how LaTeX works. 

# More Advanced Concepts

There's a lot more to learn in LaTeX before you're a pro. Check out these articles to learn about some more advanced concepts that we use at the ITAC every day.

# Reference

So after you read that article about tables, you were probably a little bit scared. Fear not! Just use a [LaTeX table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com). This one is great because it allows you to direcly paste from excel. 

When you're trying to figure out how to type a strange symbol, check out this [List of LaTeX Symbols](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols). 

Finally, if you're stuck, ChatGPT is a great resource for figuring out how to format something in LaTeX. However, you do have to verify that its output is correct and that it matches the style of our reports.
